p1: implement static table-based scheduler
p2: validation/verification/use-case            ->   have examples to show that the scheduler works (imagine that the buttons are 
                                                    supposed to be a sensor of a machine that gives the input to our program)


every 100 ms (for example) there has to be a task that awakens the scheduler











possibilities:
we need a function to add a task to the system
we need a function to start the scheduler and maybe stop it too
a function to print the contents of the table
